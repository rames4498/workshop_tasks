About Dataset
Context
AqSolDB is created by the Autonomous Energy Materials Discovery [AMD] research group, consists of aqueous solubility values of 9,982 unique compounds curated from 9 different publicly available aqueous solubility datasets. This openly accessible dataset, which is the largest of its kind, and will not only serve as a useful reference source of measured solubility data, but also as a much improved and generalizable training data source for building data-driven models.

Content
In addition to curated experimental solubility values, AqSolDB also contains some relevant topological and physico-chemical 2D descriptors calculated by RDKit. Additionally, AqSolDB contains validated molecular representations of each of the compounds.

Citation
If you use AqSolDB in your study, please cite the following paper.
